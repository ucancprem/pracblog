#Adapter Pattern
-Mostly used for new code to work old/legacy code without any changes to the contract.
-Obvious example : Plug adapter, but instead of one type/design of the adapter(plug hardware adapter) you could have 'n' number of adapter that fits
-Pretty much translates request from code to the code we have(mostly legacy code)
-Java example -> Arrays to list, Streams(Stream classes have adapters to work with streams/readers)
